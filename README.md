# 09-README

## Description

My motivation to complete this project was to make sure I do not fall too far behind in class. I also wanted to revisit node.js since our lessons were before christmas break. I built this because this is my first project for the back end side of development. I am a hands on learner, so this helps me understand. I learned that things are not as complicated as they seem and you should never be afraid to ask for help.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I went through all the node class activities again, but thank you to my teachers assistant Daniel for clarifying a few things regarding this assignment.
