# 09-README

## Description

My motivation to complete this project was to make sure I do not fall too far behind in class. I also wanted to revisit node.js since our lessons were before christmas break. I built this because this is my first project for the back end side of development. I am a hands on learner, so this helps me understand. I learned that things are not as complicated as they seem and you should never be afraid to ask for help.
